    "text": "2.1 Hispanic Origin\nOMB defines Hispanic/Latino origin as anyone with “a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race” (Figure 2). This definition encompasses people who are from a Spanish-speaking country of Central or South America, and the Caribbean (such as Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Colombia, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, or Cuba), as well as Spain.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Definition of Hispanic Origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Census Questionnaire Instructional Note\n\n\n\nTo inform respondents that Hispanic ethnicity and race are separate concepts on the census, an instructional note prefaces the ethnicity and race questions (Figure 3). Hispanic ethnicity was determined using question 8 (Figure 4). Respondents were tabulated as Hispanic if they marked a check box next to a “yes” category (Figure 4 (a)) or wrote in a valid response in the write-in area of the “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” category (Figure 4 (b), Figure 4 (c)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in Using Examples\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Mutually Exclusive Hispanic Ethnicity\n\n\n\nExample groups represent the largest Hispanic groups in the U.S. (Figure 4 (b)).

In this schema, respondents who responded “yes” to any category on question 8 were categorized as Hispanic, irrespective of what they answered on the race question that followed. Those who checked the response, “No, not of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” were considered non-Hispanic. In this document only race responses of non-Hispanic respondents are examined."

    "section": "2.2 How OMB Defines Race",
    "text": "2.2 How OMB Defines Race\nOMB delineates race groups by geographic origin. More specifically, race groups have “origins in any of the original peoples” of specified regions.6 The five race groups delineated include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (having origins in the Pacific Islands), American Indian or Alaska Native (the continents of North and South America), Asian (Asia), Black (Black racial groups of Africa), and White (Europe, Middle East, and North Africa) (Figure 5). The Census Bureau further notes that these standards “generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically.” 7 While OMB considers these race categories to be “comprehensive in coverage,” it permits a sixth Some Other Race (SOR) category for respondents who do not identify with the five race groups (Figure 6). Prior to the 2010 Census, however, the burgeoning SOR category was at risk of being eliminated by the Census Bureau. Given concerns that forcing respondents to identify racially with OMB’s categories would undermine the quality of the data,8 the Census Bureau retained the SOR category on the census questionnaire.9 Respondents can also identify with multiple groups (Figure 7).\n\n\n\nDefinitions of 2020 Census Race Groups\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: OMB’s Five Race Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Some Other Race\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Two or More Races\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2020 race question instructed all respondents to “Mark one or more boxes AND print origins (Figure 1 (b)). Respondents were given the option to select White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, detailed Asian subgroups, detailed Native Hawaiian-Pacific Islander subgroup, and SOR. New in 2020, Black and White respondents could for the first time report their origins alongside their race. It is important to keep in mind, however, that OMB’s definitions specify which subgroups conform to each racial category. The significance of category definitions is explored when we discuss how respondents are classified as multiracial in Section 2.4.\nTo guide respondents, the Census Bureau gives example groups that fall under each category. But, like the Hispanic ethnicity question, the examples given are not exhaustive. Section 2.2.1 presents different ways responses are tabulated to three of OMB’s major race groups.\n\n\n2.2.1 Coding Scenarios\n\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 8: White\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Black\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Asian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on each tab to view scenarios by race.\n\nThe Census Bureau tabulates race responses using a combination of marked checkboxes and write-in responses. Marked boxes without write-in responses are autocoded to that category. For instance, respondents who marked White, Black, or Asian checkboxes without writing in an origin were tabulated as those groups.\n\nWrite-in responses are independently coded and then assigned to a race category regardless of where they were written in the race question. This means that to comply with OMB’s racial guidelines, some responses in the Census Bureau’s final tabulation may differ from how respondents self-identified on the questionnaire. For example, when origins do not meet the definition of a category—as in the case of Polish, South African, and Taiwanese written under the SOR category in the examples above—they are reclassified to their proper category. Regardless of how a write-in response is classified or reclassified, checkboxes are always honored, meaning that reclassified write-in responses can lead to possibly unintended identification as two or more races (Section 2.4)."

    "text": "2.3 Some Other Race\nRespondents are classified as SOR alone if they check the SOR category without providing a write-in response (Figure 11 (a)) or marked the box and entered any of the groups found in Table 1. Intended as a residual category, SOR captures a diverse set of identities. It includes nationalities without a dominant racial group (e.g., Guyanese or Brazilian) and ambiguous terms that can apply to multiple groups (e.g., Indian, “mixed,” or multiracial). The 2020 Census National Redistricting Data Technical Documentation offers examples of detailed response that are classified as SOR. The bolded groups in Table 1 are those with a presence in New York City. Notably, Guyanese and Brazilian, two large non-Hispanic groups in New York City, are classified as SOR because their origins do not suggest a definitive racial identity. Figure 11 details acceptable and reclassified responses under the SOR category. Guyanese is an acceptable write-in response under the SOR category because OMB does not defined it racially (Figure 11 (b)). Sometimes when respondents do not see their group listed under one of the major racial categories they write it in the SOR category.10 If OMB has already defined these groups racially the Census Bureau reclassifies the response as in the case of Trinidadian (Figure 11 (c)), which is defined as a Black racial group.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified to the Black Category\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Some Other Race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Write-in Responses Categorized as Some Other Race \n  \n    \n    \n      Aruban\n      Cabo Verdean\n    \n  \n  \n    Belizean\nAborigines\n    Bermudan\nCayman Islander\n    Brazilian\nComorian\n    Caribbean\nMauritanian\n    Creole\nAryan\n    Guyanese\nIndian\n    Guyanese Indian\nIndigenous\n    North American\nTurkic\n    Surinamese\nAmeriasian\n    Hispanic origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican\nEurasian\n    Other Caribbean or South American Responses, n.e.c.\nMultiracial/Multiethnic/Biracial/Interacial/Multicultural"

    "section": "2.4 Two or More Races",
    "text": "2.4 Two or More Races\nAmong the 1997 revisions to the standards for gathering and reporting data on race and ethnicity was a directive to allow for the reporting of more than one race.12 Following OMB’s guidelines, respondents were given the option to check off more than one race on a census questionnaire for the first time in 2000, and those who did were then tabulated into a “two or more” races category. In the 2020 Census “two or more races” referred to the reporting of more than one of the six major race categories with 57 possible combinations (Figure 7). Respondents could check off two or more responses across categories (Figure 12 (a)) or write in an origin not listed as an example group (Figure 12 (b)). In these two examples, both responses would be categorized as White in combination with Asian. A respondent can enter multiple subgroups (e.g., German, Irish), but they are each tallied once for their respective group (Figure 12 (b)).\n\nChanges in the 2020 Census race questionnaire resulted in unanticipated and, perhaps, unintended ways for respondents to be classified as two or more races. This is due to the stipulation that write-in response on origin must match the racial category’s definition. When the Census Bureau perceives a dissonance between the racial category the respondent checked and the origin entered in the category’s write-in area, it reassigns mismatched write-in responses to the category whose definition it best fits.13 For example, respondents who identify as Black racially with origins in Guyana are categorized as Black in combination with SOR because Guyanese is not a Black racial group according to OMB (Figure 6). Likewise, Brazilian written under the White category is tabulated as White and SOR because, like the Guyanese, Brazilian does not indicate a definitive race group (see Section 2.3).\nQuestionnaire changes primarily affected the city’s Black and White respondents, some of whom may have been counted as a single race in the previous decade but were identified as multiracial in 2020 due to writing in an origin that does not map into OMB’s racial schema. While the census is based on self-identification, the limitations set by OMB’s definitions of race and Hispanic origin create a constant negotiation between responses and their coding and tabulation into reliable and usable data. As a result, respondents could be assigned to categories in the final tabulation that they did not select.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Checked Two Different Categories\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Write-in Responses Fall Under Two Different Categories\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Write-in Ethnicity Reclassified as a Different Race\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Two or More Races\n\n\n\nIn Figure 12 (c) respondents who wrote Guyanese under the Black category were classified as two or more races—Black and SOR."

The multiracial population identifying as White in combination with one or more other races also more than doubled, from 81,500 to 188,000, with the increase in the White and SOR population accounting for just over one-quarter of this increase. It seems that changes to the questionnaire disproportionately affected the Black population and, to a lesser extent, the White population. Taken together these results suggest that some Black, as well as White respondents, who may have been counted as a single race in the previous decade had their origins treated as a separate race, rather than an inclusive component of their identity, and were identified as multiracial.\n\nWhile the above increases in the multiracial population may have been misleading, other changes reflected a real demographic shift in the number of respondents identifying as being of two or more races. The multiracial population that was Black and White more than doubled in size, from 22,900 in 2010 to 46,800 in 2020, and the multiracial population identifying as White and Asian also saw a near two-fold increase, to 76,900.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: New York City’s Multiracial Combinations, 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\nIn order to show the impact of the large increase in the multiracial population on single race groups, we assign multiple race responses back to their constituent single-race groups, creating a combined “all-inclusive total” for race groups.15 So, a multiracial respondent who identified as being both Black and White, was counted as being Black alone and in combination, as well as White alone and in combination. This method of allocating responses to all categories that applied was preferred over a fractional reapportionment that treats identity as a sum of parts. An “all-inclusive” total also reflects the simultaneity of identity rather parsing it into mutually exclusive categories.\n\n\nFigure 14 shows the impact of an all-inclusive total on the overall count of each race group: The decline of 3,000 in the White single-race population contrasts with an increase of 100,400 in the White alone and in combination population; the 84,400 decline in the Black single-race population is attenuated to a decline of just 9,300; and the Asian alone population increase of 345,400 is augmented to 385,600.\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Non-Hispanic Race Alone and In Combination, 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\nIncreases in the multiracial population identifying as White and Asian are real—questionnaire changes had a minimal impact on the overall growth of this multiracial population. However, the questionnaire change had a big impact on the increase in the multiracial population identifying as Black in combination with SOR."

    "text": "A nice aspect of LaTeX is all the custom font options that you have. However, specification of fonts can be frustrating because fonts are specific to your operating system and finding out what fonts you have and what they are called can be difficult. Fonts being specific to the computer you are on also interferes with cross-platform portability.\ntldr; Jump the section on using font packages.\n\n\nStart with the Quarto section on specifying fonts for PDF, but be aware that many of the commands will not work “out of the box”. As noted in the manual, yaml such as mainfont takes the name of any “system font”. Determining what system fonts you have can be a chore. So I do not use Quarto’s font specifications via say mainfont. LaTeX and fonts is just too finicky and I find it easier to specify my font directly. See section below on using a font file or font package to get fonts.\n\n\n\nIf you are using the scrbook and scrartcl documentclasses that are default with Quarto, be aware that KOMA is a bit non-intuitive with font specification. Specifically, it does not use mainfont for the chapter, section, caption, caption labels…the list goes on and on. Getting all your documents in the same font can be a tedious process. You need to specify that separately. The default for KOMA-Script headers is sans serif and bold (\\sffamily\\bfseries) while the default for the main text is serif (\\rmfamily).\nNote, if you don’t like these design choices then switching to another book document class would be wise. Because resetting all of these for KOMA-Script is going to be annoying.\nHere are some options for changing your header fonts.\nDefault roman but still bold.\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\addtokomafont{disposition}{\\rmfamily}\nSomething like this should work too\n\\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalcolor\\bfseries}\nExactly as in the text body (i.e., not bold)\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nOnly change the chapters to serif:\n\\addtokomafont{chapter}{\\rmfamily}\nChange the captions and caption labels\n\\setkomafont{caption}{\\normalfont}\n\\setkomafont{captionlabel}{\\normalfont}\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you know the font is installed and you know its name, you can use that whenever you are asked for font-family in the yaml.\n\n\n\nYou can download an opentype font file (otf or ttf) and use that. Download from here. Note, in the _extensions/nmfs-opensci/titlepage folder, you will find the QT opentype font files.\nYou can use that font file as a font name anywhere you are asked for a font. For example:\nmainfont: \"QTDublinIrish.otf\"\ntitlepage-theme:\n  title-fontfamily: QTDublinIrish.otf\nIf however you are using a KOMA-Script document class and want to change the header to a different font (that is not the main font) then you need to do something different.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\newfontfamily\\myFont{QTDublinIrish.otf}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\myFont}\n\n\n\nThe standard way to change all the fonts in a LaTeX document is to use a package in the header. Here is some help on packages. Below I give a curated selection of font packages.\nHow does a font package work? Different ones behave differently. Some just create a font-family and you have issue a command like\n\\fontfamily{&lt;fontname&gt;}\\selectfont\nUnfortunately the documentation doesn’t always tell you the font name. Instead sometimes they tell you a command you need to issue to “turn on” the font for a section of your document. I will not cover these types of packages.\nOther packages will redefine a serif font (\\rmfamily), a sans serif font (\\sffamily) and a tele-type family. When you load these packages, the font changes because the fonts for sections are defined using say \\rmfamily. Below are some standard versions of these packages with the instructions that you need in your include-in-header section of your yaml.\nChange serif font to Times, sans serif to Helvetica, and tt to Courier. The \\renewcommand bit is setting the default family to Times (named ptm).\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{mathptmx}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{ptm}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nThe mathptmx page says it is obsolete. So you might use newtx but I haven’t had 100 percent luck with this package. Particularly there seems to be some conflict with \\usepackage{newtxmath} which you’d want for your math.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[type1text]{newtxtext}\n        \\usepackage{unicode-math} \n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange all the text fonts to Palatino.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{mathpazo}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{ppl} % Palatino is named ppl\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Helvetica\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage{helvet}\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{phv}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Avant Garde\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{avant}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pag}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Bookman\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{bookman}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pbk}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Courier\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{courier}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pcr}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Zaph Chancery\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{chancery}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pzc}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}"

Because resetting all of these for KOMA-Script is going to be annoying.\nHere are some options for changing your header fonts.\nDefault roman but still bold.\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\addtokomafont{disposition}{\\rmfamily}\nSomething like this should work too\n\\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalcolor\\bfseries}\nExactly as in the text body (i.e., not bold)\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nOnly change the chapters to serif:\n\\addtokomafont{chapter}{\\rmfamily}\nChange the captions and caption labels\n\\setkomafont{caption}{\\normalfont}\n\\setkomafont{captionlabel}{\\normalfont}"

    "text": "If you know the font is installed and you know its name, you can use that whenever you are asked for font-family in the yaml.\n\n\n\nYou can download an opentype font file (otf or ttf) and use that. Download from here. Note, in the _extensions/nmfs-opensci/titlepage folder, you will find the QT opentype font files.\nYou can use that font file as a font name anywhere you are asked for a font. For example:\nmainfont: \"QTDublinIrish.otf\"\ntitlepage-theme:\n  title-fontfamily: QTDublinIrish.otf\nIf however you are using a KOMA-Script document class and want to change the header to a different font (that is not the main font) then you need to do something different.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\newfontfamily\\myFont{QTDublinIrish.otf}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\myFont}\n\n\n\nThe standard way to change all the fonts in a LaTeX document is to use a package in the header. Here is some help on packages. Below I give a curated selection of font packages.\nHow does a font package work? Different ones behave differently. Some just create a font-family and you have issue a command like\n\\fontfamily{&lt;fontname&gt;}\\selectfont\nUnfortunately the documentation doesn’t always tell you the font name. Instead sometimes they tell you a command you need to issue to “turn on” the font for a section of your document. I will not cover these types of packages.\nOther packages will redefine a serif font (\\rmfamily), a sans serif font (\\sffamily) and a tele-type family. When you load these packages, the font changes because the fonts for sections are defined using say \\rmfamily. Below are some standard versions of these packages with the instructions that you need in your include-in-header section of your yaml.\nChange serif font to Times, sans serif to Helvetica, and tt to Courier. The \\renewcommand bit is setting the default family to Times (named ptm).\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{mathptmx}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{ptm}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nThe mathptmx page says it is obsolete. So you might use newtx but I haven’t had 100 percent luck with this package. Particularly there seems to be some conflict with \\usepackage{newtxmath} which you’d want for your math.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[type1text]{newtxtext}\n        \\usepackage{unicode-math} \n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange all the text fonts to Palatino.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{mathpazo}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{ppl} % Palatino is named ppl\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Helvetica\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage{helvet}\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{phv}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Avant Garde\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{avant}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pag}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Bookman\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{bookman}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pbk}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Courier\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{courier}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pcr}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}\nChange fonts to Zaph Chancery\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\n        \\usepackage{chancery}\n        \\renewcommand{\\familydefault}{pzc}\n        \\setkomafont{disposition}{\\normalfont}"

For example, just last names or initials plus last name.\n\n\n\nThe background image file. Default is to make this fill the whole page. You can change the size and place the image using bg-image-left and bg-image-bottom to specify distance from left and bottom of the page.\n\nAn image file\n\n\n\n\nSome text for the header. Note “header” doesn’t mean it has to be at the top. You can place your elements however you want using the distance from the bottom of the page, e.g. \n  coverpage-theme:\n    header-left: 1in\n    header-bottom: 1in\nputs the header in the lower left corner, 1 inch from the left and bottom.\n\n\n\nSome text for the footer. Note “footer” doesn’t mean it has to be at the bottom. That is just the default. You can place your elements however you want using the distance from the bottom of the page, e.g. \n  coverpage-theme:\n    footer-bottom: 10in\n\n\n\n\nThe cover page has the following elements: page, title, author, header, footer, date, bg-image. Each of these can be customized via the coverpage-theme.\nExample:\n    coverpage-theme: \n      page-html-color: \"c4c4c4\" # html color\n      title-style: \"plain\"\n      title-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      title-fontstyle: [\"Huge\", \"bfseries\"]\n      title-align: left\n      title-location-bottom: \"0.5\\\\paperheight\"\n      title-location-left: 1in\n\n\nThe page color as an html color; leave off the leading #.\n\n\n\nFor title, author, header, footer, date, these can be\n\nplain\nnone the element won’t be shown at all\n\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date.\nDo not use both page-html-color and page-color. Choose one. page-color will use names.\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want in your LaTeX header. For example, define the color mygreen include this in your format yaml. Then you can use mygreen as a color name.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date.\nThe fontfamily can be specified for the page and will be used for all the elements unless you pass in an element specific font family, like title-fontfamily. The font family can be a name that you have in your font library or it can be a font file. You can download lots of different font files. The is the most surefire way to get your fonts to work.\nThe extension has an example font file: QTDublinIrish.otf and the extension has the Qualitype fonts. To use these, specify your font as _extensions/nmfs-opensci/titlepage/fonts/qualitype/opentype/&lt;font-file-name&gt;. To use other font files, you can download a font file from the LaTeX Font Catalogue. The otf (opentype) and ttf files should work. Some fonts will have font styling like “bold” so you will need to use the font file with the styling you want. Or you probably can download the folder with regular, italic etc files and pass in the font directory name. Note not all fonts have all styling. For example, small caps (textsc) is only available for some fonts.\nI have fonts on my machine but Quarto can’t find them! Good luck. Stackoverflow will hopefully help you. Fonts that cannot be found is a source of much TeX misery. Using font files that you specify directly avoids this problem.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nThis is a list of styles to add. [\"tiny\", \"textit\"] would be tiny size italic text. It needs to be styles that LaTeX knows; don’t add \\ to the name. Sizes: tiny, small, normal, large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge. Styles: “textsc”, “textit”, “textbf”, “uppercase”, “lowercase”, “bfseries”. Are common ones.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date. Note, this will be ignored if you pass in a font size (like \"large\") in -fontfamily.\nThe font size in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date.\nThe spacing between lines if text runs into multiple lines. Specify in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number. If you only specify fontsize, it will use 1.2 fontsize as the spacing.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nThe page alignment: left, right or center. For title, subtitle, author, header, and footer, you can also specify spread and it will spread the text across the whole page.\n\n\n\nAvailable for bg-image, title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nHow much (in degrees) to rotate the element.\n\n\n\nFor title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nDistance from the left side of page to the left side of element (align = left) or right side of page to the right side of element (align = right). Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n\n\n\nAvailable for bg-image, title, author, header, footer, date, logo.\nDistance from the bottom of page to the bottom of element. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperheight\" or \"0.9\\\\textheight\".\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nWidth of the box that holds the text. Smaller will mean that the text is wrapped. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n*If you pass in -left for an element, you must also pass in -width for that element. Since you can pass in widths in any units, there is no way to compute a width for you.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nThese elements appear in the LaTeX file in tikz node. You can pass many different specifications to nodes. There are so many options. See https://tikz.dev/ or just try Googling tikz and what you want.\nHere is an example of putting the title in a red 4 cm high box with 10mm padding. Sadly, the width needs to be set by title-width. The other elements (footer, header, date) use the same format and will behave similarly.\n      title-node-spec: \"fill=red, inner sep=10mm, minimum height=4cm\"\n      title-width: \"8cm\"\n\n\n\nDistance from the left side of page to the left side of image. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n\n\n\nThe background image width. Measurement is in any units that LaTeX knows (in, cm, mm, pt) or something like \"0.5\\\\paperwidth\" or \"0.9\\\\textwidth\".\n\n\n\nThe transparency of the background image.\n\n\n\nSide to fade of the image. Can be “top”, “north”, “bottom”, “south”, “right”, “east”, “left”, “west”, “fadeout”\n\n\n\n\nThese are features that you can customize. If you leave it out, it will either not set the value (so use whatever defaults LaTeX has) or will choose a theme specific default.

    "text": "The extension provides a format titlepage-pdf where you can specify a variety of themes and customizations. The video gives a 10 minute tutorial on how to use the extension to create a custom title page.\n\n\n\n\n\nquarto use template nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages\nThis will install the extension in the _extension folder plus all the demo files. Essentially, you will be cloning the repo into a new folder and you will be asked at installation for the name of the (empty) folder/directory that you want to install into.\n\n\n\nYou may also use this format with an existing Quarto project or document. This will install only the files in the _extension folder and will not install the files above that (the demo files). Use the same command to update an existing extension.\nFrom the quarto project or document directory, run the following command:\nquarto install extension nmfs-opensci/quarto_titlepages\n\n\n\n\nIn your document yaml add the format and a title page theme (or file). For example,\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    titlepage: vline\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    number-sections: true\nFor a cover page, you would add something like\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    coverpage: true\n    cover-bg-image: \"myimage.jpeg\"\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    number-sections: true\nThis would default to cover page with a full-page background image and the title at top and author at bottom, but all of that is customizable.\nThen render the document. How? That depends on the IDE you are using. There should be a render ‘button’ or drop-down or you can run this command from the shell.\nquarto render article.qmd\nassuming your qmd file is named article.qmd.\n\n\n\nAll features of the text and placement of blocks (header, title, author, etc) are customizable. See the chapters on themes and customizing. Jump to the pages on the title page themes and cover page themes to see examples.\nNeed to add a copyright or dedication page after the title page? See section on adding static files.\n\n\n\nThe document class changes the look of your document. For the book document classes, you will need to pass in\nnumber-sections: true\nin your YAML because Quarto sets number-sections: false by default and that will mess up all your equation, figure and table numbers. It simple will not number them correctly at all.\n\n\nThe KOMA scrbook document class has many options that your can use to change the look of your book. Read the documentation here.\nIf you want chapters to be allowed to start on even or odd pages and the left and right margins on even and odd pages to be the same, use\nclassoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n\n\n\nThis document class is more for single documents with sections and the equation, figure and table numbering will be 1, 2, 3, … as opposed to 1.1, 1.2, etc, with the chapter number included in the number. The default in Quarto is no section or chapter numbers. Use\nnumber-sections: true\nif you want numbers.\n\n\n\nThe cls folder has some other document classes that you can use. Specify by providing the path to the document class file. For example,\ndocumentclass: cls/krantz.cls\nThe base TeX document classes are article, report, and book. But there are many many more available to customize the look of your document. Here is a Stackoverflow post with a few discusssed here.\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a table of contents (toc: true), list of figures (lof: true) and list of tables (lot: true). The depth of the TOC is specified with toc-depth. Example:\nformat:\n  titlepage-pdf:\n    titlepage: bg-image\n    documentclass: scrartcl\n    toc: true\n    toc-depth: 3\n    lof: true\n    lot: true\n\n\n\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want with a xcolor command. Then you can refer to this color where you want to specify a color.\nformat: \n  titlepage-pdf:\n    documentclass: scrbook\n    classoption: [\"oneside\", \"open=any\"]\n    number-sections: true\n    titlepage: \"academic\"\n    titlepage-footer: |\n      NOAA Fisheries OpenSci\\\n      Tools for Open Science\\\n      [https://github.com/nmfs-opensci](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci)\\\n    coverpage: \"great-wave\"\n    coverpage-theme:\n      title-node-spec: \"fill=mygreen, inner sep=10mm, minimum height=4cm\"\n      title-width: \"8cm\"\n    titlepage-theme:\n      footer-color: mygreen\n    keep-tex: true\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}\n\n\n\nCurrently none of the titlepage themes include an abstract. However you can include a static page after the title page and add your abstract (or executive summary) to that. See section on adding static files and the example_2.qmd example file."

The code in _coverpage.tex will set its own geometry for the cover page.\nfilenames with _ don’t work across all operating systems. I always forget what symbols are bad in what operating system so I try to have no symbols in included image file names.\nUse titlepage-geometry: to move your title around so it doesn’t overlap your image.\nUse titlepage-color to get a background color that matches the image and gets a nice fade."

    "section": "",
    "text": "If you don’t pass in any customization, the default is the titlepage: plain with all elements that you specify, like titlepage-header but minimal styling.\n\n\nHere are the available top-level elements with examples:\n    titlepage: plain\n    titlepage-logo: \"img/logo.png\"\n    titlepage-bg-image: \"img/ringed-seal.png\"\n    titlepage-header: \"The Publisher\"\n    titlepage-footer: | # text\n      University Technical Series\\\n      Open Source Publication for All\n      December 2025\n    titlepage-geometry: [\"top=3in\", \"bottom=1in\", \"right=1in\", \"left=1in\"]\n\n\n\nThis is the overall theme. Default is true (which is the same as plain). false (or none) would stop the title page being generated at all. Note although titlepage specifies the overall theme, all features can be changed by passing a new value in titlepage-theme; see below.\n\nnone or false no title page\ntrue (or plain): minimal styling. Everything on the page is left-aligned, with title, subtitle, author with affiliation superscripts, and affiliations in a numbered list. Header and footer appear if title-header and/or title-footer are specified.\nvline: a 1pt wide vertical line on the left.\nvline-text: a 0.5 inch wide blue vertical line with test.\nacademic: A title and subtitle with horizontal lines.\nformal: Looks a bit like a thesis title page\nclassic-lined: different sized horizontal lines around title.\ncolorbox: title in a colored box\na file. You can pass in a static tex file for the title page. Include only the tex, no \\begin{document} or similar.\n\n\n\n\nThe logo for the title page. It doesn’t use logo from the main yaml.\n\n\n\nThe background image file. Default is to make this fill the whole page. See the bg-image theme for how to put this in the top-left corner and make smaller. You can tile the image too.\n\n\n\nSome text for the header. Note “header” doesn’t mean it has to be at the top. You can order your elements however you want using the elements in titlepage-theme.\n\n\n\nSome text for the footer. Note “footer” doesn’t mean it has to be at the bottom. That is just the default. You can order your elements however you want.\n\n\n\nThis sets the margins for the text area. If you have a background image in a top corner for example, you need to pass this in to shift the text area down so it doesn’t overlap your image.\ntitlepage-geometry: [\"top=3in\", \"bottom=1in\", \"right=1in\", \"left=1in\"]\n\n\n\n\nThe title page has the following elements: page, title, subtitle, author, header, footer, logo, vline, bg-image. Each of these can be customized via titlepage-theme.\nExample:\n    titlepage-theme: \n      page-html-color: \"c4c4c4\" \n      title-style: \"plain\"\n      title-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      title-fontstyle: [\"Huge\", \"bfseries\"]\n      title-align: left\n      title-space-after: 1in\n\n\nWhat elements do you want to appear and in what order? You can also add text to add between the elements. The element names are \\\\titleblock, \\\\authorblock, \\\\affiliationblock, \\\\headerblock, \\\\footerblock, \\\\dateblock, \\\\logoblock.\nAn example specification would be\n    titlepage-theme: \n      elements: [\"\\\\logoblock\", \"\\\\authorblock\", \"\\\\vfill\", \"\\\\titleblock\", \"Some text at the bottom\"] \nThis puts the logo at the top, followed by the author block, then some stretchable space followed by the title and some text. Basically in the tex file this will appear like\n\\logoblock\n\\vspace{logo-space-after}\n\\authorblock\n\\vspace{author-space-after}\n\\vfill\n\\titleblock\n\\vspace{title-space-after}\nSome text at the bottom\nKnowing this, you can see how you might include things like horizontal lines and any text with TeX formatting in your title page. The alignment of Some text at the bottom will be governed by page-align in this case.\n\n\n\nThe page color as an html color; leave off the leading #.\n\n\n\nFor title, header, footer, date, these can be\n\nplain no lines or boxes around element\ndoubleline a line on the top and bottom\ncolorbox element in a a color filled box\nnone the element won’t be shown at all\n\nFor author-style, these can be\n\nplain authors listed with author-sep as separation.\nplain-with-and same as plain but the last two authors will be separated with and\nsuperscript like plain but superscripts for affiliations\nsuperscript-with-and like plain-with-and but superscripts for affiliations\nauthor-address each author on a separate line with address(es)\n\nNote author-sep: \"newline\" will give each author on a new line. If you want to specify the character separating authors in a list, keep in mind that Pandoc strips all preceeding and following whitespace. So to specify \" -- \" as the separation you need to use \"\\ --\\ \".\nFor affiliation-style, these can be\n\nnumbered-list each affiliation gets a number on a new line\nnumbered-list-with-correspondence add a line for the corresponding author.\n\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nDo not use both page-html-color and page-color. Choose one. page-color will use names. What names are available? Google latex xcolor. Standard color names.\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want with a xcolor command. Then you can refer to this color where you want to specify a color. You define the color in your LaTeX header. For example, define the color mygreen by including this in your format yaml and then you can use mygreen as a color name.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThe fontfamily can be specified for the page and will be used for all the elements unless you pass in an element specific font family, like title-fontfamily. The font family can be a name that you have in your font library or it can be a font file. You can download lots of different font files. The is the most surefire way to get your fonts to work.\nThe extension has an example font file: QTDublinIrish.otf and the extension has the Qualitype fonts. To use these, specify your font as _extensions/nmfs-opensci/titlepage/fonts/qualitype/opentype/&lt;font-file-name&gt;. To use other font files, you can download a font file from the LaTeX Font Catalogue. The otf (opentype) and ttf files should work. Some fonts will have font styling like “bold” so you will need to use the font file with the styling you want. Or you probably can download the folder with regular, italic etc files and pass in the font directory name. Note not all fonts have all styling. For example, small caps (textsc) is only available for some fonts.\nI have fonts on my machine but Quarto can’t find them! Good luck. Stackoverflow will hopefully help you. Fonts that cannot be found is a source of much TeX misery. Using font files that you specify directly avoids this problem. You should also be aware that LaTeX uses packages to change the fonts, which will be surprising if you don’t come from a LaTeX background. See the chapter on fonts.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThis is a list of styles to add. [\"tiny\", \"textit\"] would be tiny size italic text. It needs to be styles that LaTeX knows; don’t add \\ to the name. Sizes: tiny, small, normal, large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge. Styles: “textsc”, “textit”, “textbf”, “uppercase”, “lowercase”, “bfseries”. Are common ones.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date. Note, this will be ignored if you pass in a font size (like \"large\") in -fontfamily.\nThe font size in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number, like title-fontsize: 20.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThe spacing between lines if text runs into multiple lines. Specify in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number like title-spacing: 24. If you only specify fontsize, it will use 1.2 fontsize as the spacing.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date, logo.\nThe page alignment: left, right or center. For title, subtitle, author, header, and footer, you can also specify spread and it will spread the text across the whole page.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, affiliation, header, footer, date, logo.\nHow much space to add after the element. Can be in, cm, mm, pt or percent of paper or text, e.g. 0.5\\\\textheight. Note, in elements, you can have a \\\\vfill somewhere if you want the text spread fully from top to bottom. Like so\ntitlepage-theme:\n  elements: [\"\\\\titleblock\", \"\\\\vfill\", \"\\\\logoblock\"]\nNote that you need title-space-after to not be set to 0 for \\vfill to work here. It’s a quirk of LaTeX that for \\vfill to work, you have to have a \\vspace{} line and title-space-after will be translated to \\vspace{title-space-after} in the TeX file. By default, all the elements have a non-zero space-after, so you shouldn’t run into trouble unless you were to set title-space-after: 0 here.\n\n\n\nSpace to add between the title and subtitle.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nIf -style is colorbox, you can specify the colorbox features:\n\n-colorbox-fill fill color\n-colorbox-borderwidth width of the border (in, cm, mm, pt)\n-colorbox-bordercolor border color\n\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want in your LaTeX header. For example, define the color mygreen include this in your format yaml. Then you can use mygreen as a color name.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}\n\n\n\nThe background image size. Specify this with units like in, cm, mm, pt or as a fraction of the paper or text like 0.5\\\\paperwidth.\n\n\n\nWhere to pin the image. Can be\n\nURCorner upper right corner\nULCorner upper left corner`\nLRCorner lower right corner\nLLCorner lower left corner\nTileSquare tile the image\n\n\n\n\nAdd a fade to the image. Can be\n\ntop, north top of image\nleft, west left side of image\nright, east right side of image\nbottom, south bottom of image\nfadeout fade out in a circle starting from center\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical rule specifications are\n\nvrule-width the width as in, cm, mm, pt (e.g. “1cm”) or a fraction of the paper or text like \"0.1\\\\textwidth\".\nvrule-color names of colors. It’s the xcolors and you can define colors.\nvrule-align left, right, leftright. The latter makes a rule on both sides.\nvrule-space-after the gap between the vertical rule and the text\nvrule-text text to put in the vertical rule\nvrule-text-color color of the text\nvrule-text-style text styles. See above on what styles are possible.\n\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want in your LaTeX header. For example, define the color mygreen include this in your format yaml. Then you can use mygreen as a color name.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}\n\n\n\n\nThese are features that you can customize. If you leave it out, it will either not set the value (so use whatever defaults LaTeX has) or will choose a theme specific default. See the themes.\n    titlepage-theme: \n      elements: [\"\\\\titleblock\", \"Some text\", \"\\\\authorblock\"]\n      page-html-color: \"c4c4c4\"\n      page-color: green # use either html-color or color\n      page-text-align: center\n      page-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      page-fontsize: 40\n      page-spacing: 48\n      title-style: \"plain\"\n      title-color: \"white\"\n      title-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      title-fontsize: 14\n      title-spacing: 16\n      title-fontstyle: [\"textit\", \"bfseries\"]\n      title-align: spread\n      title-space-after: 1in\n      title-colorbox-fill: \"cyan\"\n      title-colorbox-borderwidth: 2pt\n      title-colorbox-bordercolor: \"black\"\n      title-subtitle-space-between: \"0.1\\\\textheight\"\n      subtitle-color: \"white\" \n      subtitle-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      subtitle-fontsize: 10\n      subtitle-spacing: 12\n      subtitle-fontstyle: [\"textit\", \"bfseries\"] \n      subtitle-align: center\n      subtitle-space-after: \"1cm\" \n      author-style: \"superscript\"\n      author-sep: \",\\ \"\n      author-color: \"white\" \n      author-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      author-fontsize: 14\n      author-spacing: 16\n      author-fontstyle: [\"textsc\"]\n      author-align: center\n      author-space-after: \"0.1\\\\paperheight\" \n      affiliation-style: \"numberedlist\"\n      affiliation-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      affiliation-fontsize: 12\n      affiliation-spacing: 16\n      affiliation-fontstyle: \"large\"\n      affiliation-align: left\n      affiliation-space-after: 1in\n      footer-style: \"colorbox\"\n      footer-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      footer-fontsize: 12\n      footer-spacing: 16\n      footer-fontstyle: \"uppercase\"\n      footer-align: left\n      footer-space-after: 1in\n      footer-colorbox-fill: \"cyan\"\n      footer-colorbox-borderwidth: 2pt\n      footer-colorbox-bordercolor: \"black\"\n      header-style: \"plain\"\n      header-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      header-fontsize: 12\n      header-spacing: 20\n      header-fontstyle: \"lowercase\"\n      header-align: left\n      header-space-after: 1in\n      header-colorbox-fill: \"cyan\"\n      header-colorbox-borderwidth: 2pt\n      header-colorbox-bordercolor: \"black\"\n      date-style: \"colorbox\"\n      date-fontfamily: \"Arial\"\n      date-fontsize: 12\n      date-spacing: 20\n      date-fontstyle: [\"slseries\"]\n      date-align: left\n      date-space-after: 1in\n      date-colorbox-fill: \"cyan\"\n      date-colorbox-borderwidth: 2pt\n      date-colorbox-bordercolor: \"black\"\n      logo-align: center\n      logo-size: 0.25\n      logo-space-after: 1in\n      bg-image-size: 0.25\n      bg-image-location: \"URCorner\"\n      bg-image-fading: \"top\"\n      bg-image-opacity: 0.5\n      vrule-width: 20pt\n      vrule-color: \"blue\"\n      vrule-align: left\n      vrule-space-after: 10pt\n      vrule-text: \"Some text for inside vrule\"\n      vrule-text-color: \"white\"\n      vrule-text-style: {\"Huge\", \"textit\"}"

The element names are \\\\titleblock, \\\\authorblock, \\\\affiliationblock, \\\\headerblock, \\\\footerblock, \\\\dateblock, \\\\logoblock.\nAn example specification would be\n    titlepage-theme: \n      elements: [\"\\\\logoblock\", \"\\\\authorblock\", \"\\\\vfill\", \"\\\\titleblock\", \"Some text at the bottom\"] \nThis puts the logo at the top, followed by the author block, then some stretchable space followed by the title and some text. Basically in the tex file this will appear like\n\\logoblock\n\\vspace{logo-space-after}\n\\authorblock\n\\vspace{author-space-after}\n\\vfill\n\\titleblock\n\\vspace{title-space-after}\nSome text at the bottom\nKnowing this, you can see how you might include things like horizontal lines and any text with TeX formatting in your title page. The alignment of Some text at the bottom will be governed by page-align in this case.\n\n\n\nThe page color as an html color; leave off the leading #.\n\n\n\nFor title, header, footer, date, these can be\n\nplain no lines or boxes around element\ndoubleline a line on the top and bottom\ncolorbox element in a a color filled box\nnone the element won’t be shown at all\n\nFor author-style, these can be\n\nplain authors listed with author-sep as separation.\nplain-with-and same as plain but the last two authors will be separated with and\nsuperscript like plain but superscripts for affiliations\nsuperscript-with-and like plain-with-and but superscripts for affiliations\nauthor-address each author on a separate line with address(es)\n\nNote author-sep: \"newline\" will give each author on a new line. If you want to specify the character separating authors in a list, keep in mind that Pandoc strips all preceeding and following whitespace. So to specify \" -- \" as the separation you need to use \"\\ --\\ \".\nFor affiliation-style, these can be\n\nnumbered-list each affiliation gets a number on a new line\nnumbered-list-with-correspondence add a line for the corresponding author.\n\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nDo not use both page-html-color and page-color. Choose one. page-color will use names. What names are available? Google latex xcolor. Standard color names.\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want with a xcolor command. Then you can refer to this color where you want to specify a color. You define the color in your LaTeX header. For example, define the color mygreen by including this in your format yaml and then you can use mygreen as a color name.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThe fontfamily can be specified for the page and will be used for all the elements unless you pass in an element specific font family, like title-fontfamily. The font family can be a name that you have in your font library or it can be a font file. You can download lots of different font files. The is the most surefire way to get your fonts to work.\nThe extension has an example font file: QTDublinIrish.otf and the extension has the Qualitype fonts. To use these, specify your font as _extensions/nmfs-opensci/titlepage/fonts/qualitype/opentype/&lt;font-file-name&gt;. To use other font files, you can download a font file from the LaTeX Font Catalogue. The otf (opentype) and ttf files should work. Some fonts will have font styling like “bold” so you will need to use the font file with the styling you want. Or you probably can download the folder with regular, italic etc files and pass in the font directory name. Note not all fonts have all styling. For example, small caps (textsc) is only available for some fonts.\nI have fonts on my machine but Quarto can’t find them! Good luck. Stackoverflow will hopefully help you. Fonts that cannot be found is a source of much TeX misery. Using font files that you specify directly avoids this problem. You should also be aware that LaTeX uses packages to change the fonts, which will be surprising if you don’t come from a LaTeX background. See the chapter on fonts.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThis is a list of styles to add. [\"tiny\", \"textit\"] would be tiny size italic text. It needs to be styles that LaTeX knows; don’t add \\ to the name. Sizes: tiny, small, normal, large, Large, LARGE, huge, Huge. Styles: “textsc”, “textit”, “textbf”, “uppercase”, “lowercase”, “bfseries”. Are common ones.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date. Note, this will be ignored if you pass in a font size (like \"large\") in -fontfamily.\nThe font size in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number, like title-fontsize: 20.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date.\nThe spacing between lines if text runs into multiple lines. Specify in points. Leave off “pt”; just specify this as a number like title-spacing: 24. If you only specify fontsize, it will use 1.2 fontsize as the spacing.\n\n\n\nAvailable for page, title, subtitle, author, affiliation, header, footer, date, logo.\nThe page alignment: left, right or center. For title, subtitle, author, header, and footer, you can also specify spread and it will spread the text across the whole page.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, affiliation, header, footer, date, logo.\nHow much space to add after the element. Can be in, cm, mm, pt or percent of paper or text, e.g. 0.5\\\\textheight. Note, in elements, you can have a \\\\vfill somewhere if you want the text spread fully from top to bottom. Like so\ntitlepage-theme:\n  elements: [\"\\\\titleblock\", \"\\\\vfill\", \"\\\\logoblock\"]\nNote that you need title-space-after to not be set to 0 for \\vfill to work here. It’s a quirk of LaTeX that for \\vfill to work, you have to have a \\vspace{} line and title-space-after will be translated to \\vspace{title-space-after} in the TeX file. By default, all the elements have a non-zero space-after, so you shouldn’t run into trouble unless you were to set title-space-after: 0 here.\n\n\n\nSpace to add between the title and subtitle.\n\n\n\nAvailable for title, author, header, footer, date.\nIf -style is colorbox, you can specify the colorbox features:\n\n-colorbox-fill fill color\n-colorbox-borderwidth width of the border (in, cm, mm, pt)\n-colorbox-bordercolor border color\n\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want in your LaTeX header. For example, define the color mygreen include this in your format yaml. Then you can use mygreen as a color name.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}\n\n\n\nThe background image size. Specify this with units like in, cm, mm, pt or as a fraction of the paper or text like 0.5\\\\paperwidth.\n\n\n\nWhere to pin the image. Can be\n\nURCorner upper right corner\nULCorner upper left corner`\nLRCorner lower right corner\nLLCorner lower left corner\nTileSquare tile the image\n\n\n\n\nAdd a fade to the image. Can be\n\ntop, north top of image\nleft, west left side of image\nright, east right side of image\nbottom, south bottom of image\nfadeout fade out in a circle starting from center\n\n\n\n\nThe vertical rule specifications are\n\nvrule-width the width as in, cm, mm, pt (e.g. “1cm”) or a fraction of the paper or text like \"0.1\\\\textwidth\".\nvrule-color names of colors. It’s the xcolors and you can define colors.\nvrule-align left, right, leftright. The latter makes a rule on both sides.\nvrule-space-after the gap between the vertical rule and the text\nvrule-text text to put in the vertical rule\nvrule-text-color color of the text\nvrule-text-style text styles. See above on what styles are possible.\n\nThe xcolor LaTeX package is used so you can define any color you want in your LaTeX header. For example, define the color mygreen include this in your format yaml. Then you can use mygreen as a color name.\n    include-in-header:\n      text: |\n        \\definecolor{mygreen}{HTML}{808000}"
