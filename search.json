    "text": "2.1 Hispanic Origin\nOMB defines Hispanic/Latino origin as anyone with “a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race” (Figure 2). This definition encompasses people who are from a Spanish-speaking country of Central or South America, and the Caribbean (such as Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Colombia, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, or Cuba), as well as Spain.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Definition of Hispanic Origin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Census Questionnaire Instructional Note\n\n\n\nTo inform respondents that Hispanic ethnicity and race are separate concepts on the census, an instructional note prefaces the ethnicity and race questions (Figure 3). Hispanic ethnicity was determined using question 8 (Figure 4). Respondents were tabulated as Hispanic if they marked a check box next to a “yes” category (Figure 4 (a)) or wrote in a valid response in the write-in area of the “Yes, another Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” category (Figure 4 (b), Figure 4 (c)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in Using Examples\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Mutually Exclusive Hispanic Ethnicity\n\n\n\nExample groups represent the largest Hispanic groups in the U.S. (Figure 4 (b)).

In this schema, respondents who responded “yes” to any category on question 8 were categorized as Hispanic, irrespective of what they answered on the race question that followed. Those who checked the response, “No, not of Hispanic, Latino, or Spanish origin” were considered non-Hispanic. In this document only race responses of non-Hispanic respondents are examined."

    "section": "2.2 How OMB Defines Race",
    "text": "2.2 How OMB Defines Race\nOMB delineates race groups by geographic origin. More specifically, race groups have “origins in any of the original peoples” of specified regions.6 The five race groups delineated include Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander (having origins in the Pacific Islands), American Indian or Alaska Native (the continents of North and South America), Asian (Asia), Black (Black racial groups of Africa), and White (Europe, Middle East, and North Africa) (Figure 5). The Census Bureau further notes that these standards “generally reflect a social definition of race recognized in this country and not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically.” 7 While OMB considers these race categories to be “comprehensive in coverage,” it permits a sixth Some Other Race (SOR) category for respondents who do not identify with the five race groups (Figure 6). Prior to the 2010 Census, however, the burgeoning SOR category was at risk of being eliminated by the Census Bureau. Given concerns that forcing respondents to identify racially with OMB’s categories would undermine the quality of the data,8 the Census Bureau retained the SOR category on the census questionnaire.9 Respondents can also identify with multiple groups (Figure 7).\n\n\n\nDefinitions of 2020 Census Race Groups\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: OMB’s Five Race Groups\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Some Other Race\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Two or More Races\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 2020 race question instructed all respondents to “Mark one or more boxes AND print origins (Figure 1 (b)). Respondents were given the option to select White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, detailed Asian subgroups, detailed Native Hawaiian-Pacific Islander subgroup, and SOR. New in 2020, Black and White respondents could for the first time report their origins alongside their race. It is important to keep in mind, however, that OMB’s definitions specify which subgroups conform to each racial category. The significance of category definitions is explored when we discuss how respondents are classified as multiracial in Section 2.4.\nTo guide respondents, the Census Bureau gives example groups that fall under each category. But, like the Hispanic ethnicity question, the examples given are not exhaustive. Section 2.2.1 presents different ways responses are tabulated to three of OMB’s major race groups.\n\n\n2.2.1 Coding Scenarios\n\n\n\nWhite\n\n\n\n\nBlack\n\n\n\n\nAsian\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 8: White\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Black\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified Write-in\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Asian\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on each tab to view scenarios by race.\n\nThe Census Bureau tabulates race responses using a combination of marked checkboxes and write-in responses. Marked boxes without write-in responses are autocoded to that category. For instance, respondents who marked White, Black, or Asian checkboxes without writing in an origin were tabulated as those groups.\n\nWrite-in responses are independently coded and then assigned to a race category regardless of where they were written in the race question. This means that to comply with OMB’s racial guidelines, some responses in the Census Bureau’s final tabulation may differ from how respondents self-identified on the questionnaire. For example, when origins do not meet the definition of a category—as in the case of Polish, South African, and Taiwanese written under the SOR category in the examples above—they are reclassified to their proper category. Regardless of how a write-in response is classified or reclassified, checkboxes are always honored, meaning that reclassified write-in responses can lead to possibly unintended identification as two or more races (Section 2.4)."

    "text": "2.3 Some Other Race\nRespondents are classified as SOR alone if they check the SOR category without providing a write-in response (Figure 11 (a)) or marked the box and entered any of the groups found in Table 1. Intended as a residual category, SOR captures a diverse set of identities. It includes nationalities without a dominant racial group (e.g., Guyanese or Brazilian) and ambiguous terms that can apply to multiple groups (e.g., Indian, “mixed,” or multiracial). The 2020 Census National Redistricting Data Technical Documentation offers examples of detailed response that are classified as SOR. The bolded groups in Table 1 are those with a presence in New York City. Notably, Guyanese and Brazilian, two large non-Hispanic groups in New York City, are classified as SOR because their origins do not suggest a definitive racial identity. Figure 11 details acceptable and reclassified responses under the SOR category. Guyanese is an acceptable write-in response under the SOR category because OMB does not defined it racially (Figure 11 (b)). Sometimes when respondents do not see their group listed under one of the major racial categories they write it in the SOR category.10 If OMB has already defined these groups racially the Census Bureau reclassifies the response as in the case of Trinidadian (Figure 11 (c)), which is defined as a Black racial group.11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Acceptable Selection\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Acceptable Write-in\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Reclassified to the Black Category\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Some Other Race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1:  Write-in Responses Categorized as Some Other Race \n  \n    \n    \n      Aruban\n      Cabo Verdean\n    \n  \n  \n    Belizean\nAborigines\n    Bermudan\nCayman Islander\n    Brazilian\nComorian\n    Caribbean\nMauritanian\n    Creole\nAryan\n    Guyanese\nIndian\n    Guyanese Indian\nIndigenous\n    North American\nTurkic\n    Surinamese\nAmeriasian\n    Hispanic origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Puerto Rican\nEurasian\n    Other Caribbean or South American Responses, n.e.c.\nMultiracial/Multiethnic/Biracial/Interacial/Multicultural"

    "section": "2.4 Two or More Races",
    "text": "2.4 Two or More Races\nAmong the 1997 revisions to the standards for gathering and reporting data on race and ethnicity was a directive to allow for the reporting of more than one race.12 Following OMB’s guidelines, respondents were given the option to check off more than one race on a census questionnaire for the first time in 2000, and those who did were then tabulated into a “two or more” races category. In the 2020 Census “two or more races” referred to the reporting of more than one of the six major race categories with 57 possible combinations (Figure 7). Respondents could check off two or more responses across categories (Figure 12 (a)) or write in an origin not listed as an example group (Figure 12 (b)). In these two examples, both responses would be categorized as White in combination with Asian. A respondent can enter multiple subgroups (e.g., German, Irish), but they are each tallied once for their respective group (Figure 12 (b)).\n\nChanges in the 2020 Census race questionnaire resulted in unanticipated and, perhaps, unintended ways for respondents to be classified as two or more races. This is due to the stipulation that write-in response on origin must match the racial category’s definition. When the Census Bureau perceives a dissonance between the racial category the respondent checked and the origin entered in the category’s write-in area, it reassigns mismatched write-in responses to the category whose definition it best fits.13 For example, respondents who identify as Black racially with origins in Guyana are categorized as Black in combination with SOR because Guyanese is not a Black racial group according to OMB (Figure 6). Likewise, Brazilian written under the White category is tabulated as White and SOR because, like the Guyanese, Brazilian does not indicate a definitive race group (see Section 2.3).\nQuestionnaire changes primarily affected the city’s Black and White respondents, some of whom may have been counted as a single race in the previous decade but were identified as multiracial in 2020 due to writing in an origin that does not map into OMB’s racial schema. While the census is based on self-identification, the limitations set by OMB’s definitions of race and Hispanic origin create a constant negotiation between responses and their coding and tabulation into reliable and usable data. As a result, respondents could be assigned to categories in the final tabulation that they did not select.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Checked Two Different Categories\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(b) Write-in Responses Fall Under Two Different Categories\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(c) Write-in Ethnicity Reclassified as a Different Race\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Two or More Races\n\n\n\nIn Figure 12 (c) respondents who wrote Guyanese under the Black category were classified as two or more races—Black and SOR."

Almost all groups increased during this period.

The multiracial population identifying as White in combination with one or more other races also more than doubled, from 81,500 to 188,000, with the increase in the White and SOR population accounting for just over one-quarter of this increase. It seems that changes to the questionnaire disproportionately affected the Black population and, to a lesser extent, the White population. Taken together these results suggest that some Black, as well as White respondents, who may have been counted as a single race in the previous decade had their origins treated as a separate race, rather than an inclusive component of their identity, and were identified as multiracial.\n\nWhile the above increases in the multiracial population may have been misleading, other changes reflected a real demographic shift in the number of respondents identifying as being of two or more races. The multiracial population that was Black and White more than doubled in size, from 22,900 in 2010 to 46,800 in 2020, and the multiracial population identifying as White and Asian also saw a near two-fold increase, to 76,900.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: New York City’s Multiracial Combinations, 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\nIn order to show the impact of the large increase in the multiracial population on single race groups, we assign multiple race responses back to their constituent single-race groups, creating a combined “all-inclusive total” for race groups.15 So, a multiracial respondent who identified as being both Black and White, was counted as being Black alone and in combination, as well as White alone and in combination. This method of allocating responses to all categories that applied was preferred over a fractional reapportionment that treats identity as a sum of parts. An “all-inclusive” total also reflects the simultaneity of identity rather parsing it into mutually exclusive categories.\n\n\nFigure 14 shows the impact of an all-inclusive total on the overall count of each race group: The decline of 3,000 in the White single-race population contrasts with an increase of 100,400 in the White alone and in combination population; the 84,400 decline in the Black single-race population is attenuated to a decline of just 9,300; and the Asian alone population increase of 345,400 is augmented to 385,600.\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Non-Hispanic Race Alone and In Combination, 2010-2020\n\n\n\n\nIncreases in the multiracial population identifying as White and Asian are real—questionnaire changes had a minimal impact on the overall growth of this multiracial population. However, the questionnaire change had a big impact on the increase in the multiracial population identifying as Black in combination with SOR."
